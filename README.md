#Description

In this project I was provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools I must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate _a version of_ the classic arcade game Frogger. The reason fo this project is to practice using Object Oriented JavaScript using classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects.
